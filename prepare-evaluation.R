# This will create
# 1. Sheet for scoring entries, (or part of it) with FiLa as column heading, 
#    where FiLa is the first two initials of First and Last names, respectively
# 2. Single PDF with one entry per page
#    For this to work, a couple of notes:
#    a. Had to use the xelatex engine (instead of pdflatex?) to get some 
#       symbols in abstracts to display 
#    b. To insert images into the pdf, I downloaded all the images, stuck them
#       in data/images, and renamed those that could be inserted. That is, any 
#       files that were single, static images of acceptable format were renamed 
#       to FiLa.* (acceptable values of *: png, jpg). PDF and gif files were 
#       *not* renamed, prompting a message that they should be viewed online.
